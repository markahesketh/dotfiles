# README Generator

Create clear, succinct README.md files.

## Sections to include

1. **Name** - Project title (self-explanatory)
2. **Description** - What it does, why it exists, key features
3. **Installation** - Step-by-step setup instructions
4. **Usage** - Minimal code example with expected output
5. **License** - Which open source license applies

## Optional sections (include only if relevant)

- **Badges** - Build status, version, coverage (use shields.io)
- **Visuals** - Screenshots or GIFs if UI-based
- **Support** - Where to get help (issues, discussions)
- **Authors** - Credit contributors

## Guidelines

- Keep it scannable: use headers, bullet points, code blocks
- Lead with the most important information
- Show, don't tell: include a usage example
- Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the project
- Link to detailed docs rather than duplicating content

## Do not include

- Contributing guidelines (belongs in CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Roadmap or future plans
- Verbose explanations
- Redundant badges
